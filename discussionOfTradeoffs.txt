Discussion of trade-offs

The biggest advantage to only using Event Coverage for this application, is that
it makes it easiest for us to complete this assignment. It is not very robust of
a coverage criteria, and is akin to statement coverage in its short-comings. 
Event-Interaction and Length-n Event-sequence coverage both require more tests 
to be written, trading simplicity and ease of testing, for more robust tests, 
that cover more scenarios that your software may encounter. Moving up to 
Event-Interaction Coverage would force us to write significantly more tests, as 
each of the N Event-Coverage tasks would turn in to roughly N * (N-1) tests.
Length-n Event-Sequence Coverage would give the best idea of how your software 
would hold up to actual use, but also requires the most tests to be written. 
This method needs an almost unnecessary amount of tests to be written, and it is 
extremely time inefficient to try to do it, unless the program is very small.
